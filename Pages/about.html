        As someone who drifts from project to project, and often tries to find other people who want to participate in projects - this forum is meant to fill two needs:
        </p>
        
        <ol style="margin-top:20px;">
        <li style="margin-bottom:15px;">
        A communication and contributor hub for the various open source and creative commons projects I am currently working on, as well as a centralized location to access information and assets for said projects.
        </li>
        <li>
        A place for other creative individuals to network, collaborate, and share their own projects - or even simply chat and meet like minded individuals.
        </li>
        </ol>

        I am a huge advocate for the creative commons, open source software, and the overall Libre community that counters the capitalist models that are so prevalent in the online space. While members of this community don't need to share these same ideals, I would like to foster a community that can lift up and encourage others who contribute to this space.
